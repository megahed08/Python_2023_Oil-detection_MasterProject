# Python_2023_Oil-detection_MasterProject
 This Repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that is used to run the Python code for my master's thesis project with title of "Oil Spill Detection in Water Surface SAR Images using Xception Model", the Project was to train the pre-trained Xception model on SAR images to detect oil spills in water surfaces.
